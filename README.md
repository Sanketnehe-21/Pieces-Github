what is **Pieces Os?**

-*Pieces OS is like a smart assistant for developers. It helps you save, organize, and reuse code snippets effortlessly. Instead of searching for code you’ve written before, Pieces OS makes it easy to find and use 
 it again. It even suggests relevant snippets while you work, so you don’t waste time rewriting the same code. Plus, it works offline and integrates with tools like VS Code and JetBrains, making coding smoother and 
 faster.*
